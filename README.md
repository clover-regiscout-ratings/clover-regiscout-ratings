<h3>
<ins>what is regiscout ratings?</ins>　[who are you two?]
</h3>


regiscout ratings is a frequently-updated page maintained by two individuals:\
 🍎  **${{\large\mathsf{regiscout}}}$ ${{\large\mathsf{rater}}}$ ${{\color{#b34c36}\large\mathsf{apple}}}$** [[github](https://github.com/apple-regiscout-ratings)] &  🍀  **${{\large\mathsf{regiscout}}}$ ${{\large\mathsf{rater}}}$ ${{\color{#837540}\large\mathsf{clover}}}$** [[github](https://github.com/clover-regiscout-ratings)].

> these are obviously not formerly and/or currently claimed regiscout names. we understand\
> "anonymity" only goes so far on ponytown, but we kindly ask that in-game friends/mutuals\
> respect our personal boundaries by **avoiding casual interaction** during rating. thanks!　♡

| ------------- | ------------- |
| <blockquote>**regiscout raters <ins>apple</ins>** and **regiscout rater <ins>clover</ins>** do! this page was **<ins>apple's</ins>** idea; read more about the two of us [here](https://rentry.co/regiscout-ratings-info).<br/><br/> we are both two AuDHD/ND <ins>**adults**</ins> [18+] with 4 to 7-year-long hyperfixations on internet-based sociology—specifically, the psychology behind internet game roleplay sub-communities.<br/><br/> both of us have formally studied this subject since 2023, and have been personally moderating online groups since 2018, with up to 3 years specifically spent in the ponytown regiscout community since 2021.</blockquote>  <br /> | <blockquote> directly inspired by the [pt regiment rater](rentry.co/ptregimentrater), this page was created <ins>after</ins> them in september 2025. our specific purpose is to highlight the many strengths of the regiscout community, as well as bring light to the many <b><ins>non-blacklist</ins> related issues</b> that may come along with it.<br/><br/> our intent is not to cause, mention, or perpetuate drama/gossip and rumors/general toxicity. read more about us, including our accounts' pledge, on our [info page](https://rentry.co/regiscout-ratings-info).<br/><br/>  we hope to create an event standard within the regiscout community, and encourage judgement of groups not solely based off of the friend groups within them or their controversies alone. while we believe these are very important factors when deciding whether or not to join a group, we think event quality should be considered just as much! </blockquote> |
