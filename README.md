<ins>what is regiscout ratings?</ins>　[who are you two?]
</h3>


regiscout ratings is a frequently-updated page maintained by two partners:\
🍀  **regiscout rater ${{\color{#5c7c59}\large\mathsf{clover}}}$** [[github](https://github.com/clover-regiscout-ratings)] &  🍎  **regiscout rater ${{\color{#af4c43}\large\mathsf{apple}}}$** [[github](https://github.com/apple-regiscout-ratings)].
<br/>
<br/>

> these are obviously not formerly and/or currently claimed regiscout names. we only do this\
> to fully separate ourselves and limit any potential biases from the regiscout ratings project;\
> both of us understand that "anonymity" only goes so far on the internet, *especially* on pt.
> <br/>
> <br/>
> with that being said, we kindly ask that all in-game friends/mutuals please respect our\
> space and refrain from casual interaction during rating-related activities. thank you in\
> advance for respecting our personal boundaries!　♡

| <h3><ins>so, who maintains regiscout ratings?</ins></h3> | <h3><ins>why/when was regiscout ratings created?</ins></h3> |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| <blockquote>**regiscout raters <ins>apple</ins>** and **regiscout rater <ins>clover</ins>** do! this page was **<ins>apple's</ins>** idea; read more about the two of us [here](https://rentry.co/regiscout-ratings-info).<br/><br/> we are both two AuDHD/ND <ins>**adults**</ins> [18+] with 4 to 7-year-long hyperfixations on internet-based sociology—specifically, the psychology behind internet game roleplay sub-communities.<br/><br/> both of us have formally studied this subject since 2023, and have been personally moderating online groups since 2018, with up to 3 years specifically spent in the ponytown regiscout community since 2021.</blockquote>  <br /> | <blockquote> directly inspired by the [pt regiment rater](rentry.co/ptregimentrater), this page was created <ins>after</ins> them in september 2025. the two of us created regiscout-ratings to combine our almost half a decade-long online sociology hyperfixations with a community we both enjoy!<br/><br/>  our page's purpose is to showcase the many highlights of the regiscout community—while also bringing light to some of the broad range of lesser-known <b><ins>non-blacklist</ins> related issues</b> that often present themselves when attending events. our intent is not to cause, mention, or perpetuate toxicity with our ratings/opinions. to read more about us, including our **promise of kindness** and our accounts' **archival pledge,** please view our [info page](https://rentry.co/regiscout-ratings-info).<br/><br/>  we hope to create an event standard within the regiscout community, and encourage judgement of groups not solely based off of the friend groups within them or their controversies alone. while we believe these are very important factors when deciding whether or not to join a group, we think event quality should be considered just as much! </blockquote> |
