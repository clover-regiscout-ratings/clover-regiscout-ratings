| <blockquote> our rater names are obviously not formerly or currently claimed regiscout names.<br/> this is done <ins>**only**</ins> to limit potential bias during ratings, and keeps our personal connections<br/> separate from the project. our anonymity is <ins>**not**</ins> about maintaining "secrecy"—it is merely<br/> the simplest way to ensure we *always* put fairness first.<br/><br/> we kindly ask in-game friends and mutuals to please respect the project integrity—and our<br/>personal boundaries—by avoiding casual interaction during regiscout ratings. thank you! ♡ </blockquote> |

| <blockquote>**regiscout raters <ins>apple</ins>** and **regiscout rater <ins>clover</ins>** do! this page was **<ins>apple's</ins>** idea; read more about the two of us [here](https://rentry.co/regiscout-ratings-info).<br/><br/> we are both two AuDHD/ND <ins>**adults**</ins> [18+] with 4 to 7-year-long hyperfixations on internet-based sociology—specifically, the psychology behind internet game roleplay sub-communities.<br/><br/> both of us have formally studied this subject since 2023, and have been personally moderating online groups since 2018, with up to 3 years specifically spent in the ponytown regiscout community since 2021.</blockquote>  <br /> | <blockquote> directly inspired by the [pt regiment rater](rentry.co/ptregimentrater), this page was created <ins>after</ins> them in september 2025. the two of us created regiscout-ratings to combine our almost half a decade-long online sociology hyperfixations with a community we both enjoy!<br/><br/>  our page's purpose is to showcase the many highlights of the regiscout community—while also bringing light to some of the broad range of lesser-known <b><ins>non-blacklist</ins> related issues</b> that often present themselves when attending events. our intent is not to cause, mention, or perpetuate toxicity with our ratings or opinions. to read more about us, including our **promise of kindness** and our accounts' **archival pledge,** please view our [info page](https://rentry.co/regiscout-ratings-info).<br/><br/>  we hope to create an event standard within the regiscout community, and encourage judgement of groups not solely based off of the friend groups within them or their controversies alone. while we believe these are very important factors when deciding whether or not to join a group, we think event quality should be considered just as much! </blockquote> |
